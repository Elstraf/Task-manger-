# Task Manager App - Atarim

## Disclamier

I did go over the 2 hour limit I stopped after 2 hours and 30 mins. - Reading redux docs.

## Setup

You will need pnpm installed onto your local machine. Please see the installation page to get up and running with this https://pnpm.io/installation.

To get up and running clone the repo down

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Elstraf/Task-manger-.git
```

Then cd into the new directory and run

```bash
pnpm i
```

## Features Implemented

- Creating new Todos
- Updating new Todos
- Marking Todos as completed
- Delete Todos
- Statistics (Showing how many are left / how many are completed)

## If I Had More Time

- Local storage to allow todos to be persistence
- Filter and task title searching - Eg allow the user to search for a given task / fitler based of prio and due date.
- Better user feedback on deleted / creation / editing a todo EG a toast
- Unit testing
- Form validation
